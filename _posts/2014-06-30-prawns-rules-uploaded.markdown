Hello* again!

After a long wait, the rules to Prawns have successfully been uploaded. Check them out [here]({{ site.url }}/prawns/rules/)! It took a little longer than the Kalamala rules because they're longer and slightly more complex (as well as funnier) - in fact, I found it so tiring I actually had to take a break part-way through (sorry*).

More news: for those of you interested*, I have the announcement that I also (finally) got round to adding in the Google Analytics code to the site. This means I will soon be able to know a couple of statistics about who visits the site.

*I have added the asterisk in a couple of places where it sounds like I'm talking to people - or even more delusionally: loyal fans. I highly doubt this, but will continue to do it anyway. Nevertheless, the new analytics code should go some way in identifying exactly how delusional I'm being.
