I'm Back. That was quick. I'm also Daniel.

That said, I've just done something that I've been meaning to for a while (it was in the plan for the site since before the first upload over a week ago). What I'm talking about is giving seperate sub-sites separate colour schemes. This is to let each sub-site have a more unique and identifiable appearance that is tied more to the game itself rather than the Disorganisation as a whole. That said, the two main coulours are the only things that are being changed, so it should still be recogniseable a Prawnsgame site, and still just as easy to navigate. Bothe new themes are quite bright, but I hope you like them.
