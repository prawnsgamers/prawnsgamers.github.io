There are two emails you can use, one lets you contact the inventor of Cavalry, [Salih Kadri: salih@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:salih@prawnsgame.org.uk), while the other is to be used for questions or comments about the game itself: [cavalry@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:cavalry@prawnsgame.org.uk) (although it will most likely be the same person answering it, as he is the best expert we have).
