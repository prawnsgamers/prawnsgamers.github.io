There are two emails you can use, one lets you contact the cavalry section of prawnsgame for any aspects related to the game: [cavalry@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:cavalry@prawnsgame.org.uk) and the other is to inform the sub-webmaster of any issues (who, while not the creator of Cavalry, has volunteered for the role) at [zachary@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:zachary@prawnsgame.org.uk).
