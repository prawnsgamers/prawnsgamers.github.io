Cavalry is a two-sided board game that is akin to Chess and Shogi and is intended to be a more accurate reflection of a battlefield, believing both that other games place too little value on the fast paced nature of conflict and believing that a battlefield should be more brutal, death should be more common and that even the dead should play a role in the outcome of the game.

All questions about Cavalry should be directed to the emails provided in the [contact section](/cavalry/contact/) of this subsite. If in doubt about aspects of the game, there are instructions available to straighten out any differences, and for any reasons you wish to contact the section of the organisation that runs Cavalry - we are contactable through the contact page.
