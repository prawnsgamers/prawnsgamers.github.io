Cavalry is a 2 player board game that is derived from chess and is solely intended to be a more warlike chess. It is designed in a format that uses several pieces with an apparent conflicting interest. While this may seem like a strange concept, this is designed to replicate the battlefield of old such as the grassy fields of the battle of bosworth and the modern battlefield like the urban surroundings key during the libyan civil war. The fact that Cavalry replicates a battlefield is paramount throughout the game and smoothes the apparent discord between pieces on the same side.

All questions about cavalry should be directed to the email provided in the contact section of the website. If in doubt about any aspects of the game, please e-mail me to air your concerns. I recognise that cavalry is a difficult game to grasp (it is often said that it is harder than other, interesting strategy games - e.g. Prawns [www.prawnsgame.org.uk] ) but its design is highly individual and often requires an entirely new take on board games (this, of course, depends on your original take on board games).
