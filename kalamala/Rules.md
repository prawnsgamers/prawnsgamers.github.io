Here there are multiple rules for the game of kalamala. They are intended for people of varying levels of knowledge about the game. The quick rules was intended as a reference and should be used by people wishing to refresh their knowledge about the game and alrady know how to play. The short-rules are a self-glorification project intended to show how quickly kalamala can be taught. Soon to come is the complete manual for game purists and the instructional ruleset to teach people how to play.
