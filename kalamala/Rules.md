The Meaning Of Life
===================

The aim of the game of Prawns is simple. One must use their prawns (set of pieces) to eat (take / destroy) every one of the enemies prawns, without their prawns being eaten first.

The Sea
=======

Everyone knows that prawns live in the sea, and this game knows it too. Prawns is played on a square checkered board (colloquially called the sea) that is eight squares high, and eight squares across. Conventionally, it has a black square in the bottom left position, however, this is not a rule that always needs to be followed.

A prawn must, if possible, stay within the sea, however, in a very particular case (as explained in the evaporation rule), it may be forced to move out of the sea and onto dry land, where it will asphyxiate.
