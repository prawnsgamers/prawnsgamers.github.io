Since different people will have different playing abilities and levels of understanding of Kalamala, we have decided to write a few different rulesets which cater for these different needs. Either navigate to the required rules using the tabs above, or click the link next to the description of each ruleset below.

Unfortunately, we haven't yet finished writing up all the rulesets (I promise we will soon), but once we have there will be:

 - [The Teaching Rules](/kalamala/rules/teaching/): This contains a short, visual collection of possible moves and examples to create an immediate understanding of Kalamala for those who want to learn but haven't yet played a game.
 - [The Quick Rules](/kalamala/rules/quick/): These almost entirely text-only rules are designed to be quick yet precise. While not suitable for learning from, the rules are ideal as a reference to settle most disputes and jog their memory if they haven't played in a while.
 - [The Short Rules](/kalamala/rules/short/): For experienced players with too much spare time, these rules are an exercise in academia and self-glorification - in which we try to distill the entire game into as short a form as possible. Likely to be ambiguous and convoluted so definetly not a recommended way to learn or clarify rules.
 - [Coming Soon] The Complete Manual: Here, we go beyond rules and into far more varied explanation about Kalamala. Useful as another means of settling dispute and as a way of learning about some of the culture and equipment behind the game that we don't have time to go into in the other rulesets. It is long, though.
