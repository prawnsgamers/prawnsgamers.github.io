This the complete manual for Kalamala, it is a comprehensive guide how to play the game but should not be used as an introduction, but rather a supplement for those who can already play or want clarification on specific issues.

We have attempted to make this a comprehensive look at Kalamala, and tried to include all aspects details and nuances. For this reason, it is aimed at people who can play and we hope to foster a look into the smaller details of the game and give a more developed understanding of the game.

If you feel you want to learn how to play rather than clarification on a specific issue which is what the complete manual does, [the teaching rules](/kalamala/rules/teaching/) have been written to be more black and white about complex topics.

Currently these rules are only available as a .pdf like the teaching rules, but we hope to convert the content into webpage form some day.

Note: Be aware that these rules may change, to deal with even more detail and become even more comprehensive. Also, the .pdf is moderately large at ~23Mb.
