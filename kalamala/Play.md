We're currently working on a way to let you play Kalamala, both as an app and on this very webpage. Check back later, or take a look at our [Blog](/blog/) to see if there has been any news regarding progress.

We now have a finished game, but bear in mind it is still in alpha stage so may undergo radical change (although very unlikely). You can play it [here](/kalamala/play/full/).

For the record, we have an pre-finished online version written too. Dubbed the "proto-game" by its creator, it is available to [play](/kalamala/play/proto/) on our site, even though it does leave out the concept of groups: one of the most important elements of the game.
