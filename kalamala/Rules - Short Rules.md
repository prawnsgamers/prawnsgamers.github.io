These are the Short rules for Kalamala which act primarily as an item of academic interest. They are utterly useless for any practical purpose, but due to the fact that the rules of Kalamala are both few, simple to grasp, and hard to write down we decided to 'compete' to get a ruleset that describes the entire game in as few words and characters as possible. The result you see below.

We are happy to say that this 'competition' is completely open, so if you think that you can describe the entire game up in fewer words or characters than we have below, please email us all (see our [contact page](/contact/) and, if it really does do better than the current one, we'll put it up instead of ours - with your name as author (unless you want to use a pseudonym)!

Please note that the terms used in this ruleset are by no means the standard terms that most people will use.

Rules
=====

A 2-player game played on a square grid of 64 spaces. Each player is given 4 reserve stones and places 4 others on the board in the 2 squares in 2 opposing quadrants, such that they are orthogonally adjacent to the square in that quadrant that is the board’s centremost. In any one turn a player may place a sole unused stone on a vacant space on the board, or choose any n-long diagonal or orthogonal row of their stones, which are adjacent to each other and will not move, to move an m-long row of other stones adjacent to each other and all of one type in either direction by n÷m places, rounded down if not whole, along the common line formed by extending each row towards the other, as long as there are no stones in the places between the two rows, on the path to, and at the m-row’s target, while it also may not return play to how it was before the previous turn. Any stones that are not on the board by the end of the turn are removed and the other player’s turn begins. A winner is decided when the other player cannot make their turn.
