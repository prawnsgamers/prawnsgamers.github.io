These are the Teaching rules for Kalamala which act primarily as a short, introductory course into Kalamala.

We have tried not to use too much difficult or abstract terminology, and tried to focus on the game rather than the way we describe it. For this reason, it is aimed at newcomers and we hope to develop an intuitive, rather than strictly mathematical understanding of the game.

If you feel you have understood the majority of these rules, but would like clarification on a specific issue, [the quick rules](/kalamala/rules/quick/) have been written to be more black and white about complex topics.

Currently these rules are only available ad a .pdf at A4 size, but we hope to republish them at A5 and duplicate the content on this webpage.
