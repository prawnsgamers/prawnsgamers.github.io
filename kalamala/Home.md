Kalamala is a board game, more precisely defined as an abstract strategy game (which is to say an unthemed, perfect-information, luckless, non-legacy game) akin to the likes of Chess and Abalone. The play time can range from 10 to 20 minutes, and is highly dependant on the confidence of the players. The game is highly intuitive and, while increased experience does lead to an overall higher quality of play, the contestant with less experience is often able to win if they strategise enough.

It should be noted that Kalamala is well tested, and has been judged by a number of people to be easy to learn. The game was created by Daniel Sherlock and Salih Kadri, two people with very different approaches to abstract strategy games, which helps give it a balanced playing style and as time has gone on it has been refined, becoming more dynamic and giving more control to the players to decide how they want to play. This helps to allow them to play to their own preferences rather than forcing them into any particular style of play.

The game is intended to provide mental stimulation, enjoyment, competition and deeper thinking. It is by no means a game of absolutes and in a significant proportion of games, a player who seems to be losing can, with one or two well thought out moves, reverse the balance of play and heavily disrupt the opponents flow. It is important to note that Kalamala is not a copy or “rip-off” of any other game in the genre. While its creators are indeed familiar with other games in the genre, anyone thinking of it as a modified “Chess” game is extremely mistaken.

The game itself is considered stable and it is now likely that most new aspects when it comes to the game will come in the form of spin offs which we hope to document well. For alternative methods to play the game, we currently have a team working to make it available on as many digital formats as possible. You can check their progress on the [Blog](/blog/) and the [Play](/kalamala/play/) page. 

NB: The name Kalamala is actually incredibly new compared to the game. The older name is Kineo, and you will still find many who call it this. If you wish to 'correct' them (assuming one name is somehow more correct than any other), then please do so gently, and infrequently as it is liable to cause offence.
