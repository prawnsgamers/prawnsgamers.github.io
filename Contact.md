The easiest way to contact us is by email, and we would love to hear from you (especially if you've spotted a mistake we should fix somewhere on this site). Each member has their own email address, listed below:

| Zachary Barnett:&nbsp;&nbsp; | [zachary@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:zachary@prawnsgame.org.uk) |
| Daniel Sherlock:&nbsp;&nbsp; | [daniel@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:daniel@prawnsgame.org.uk) |
| Salih Kadri:&nbsp;&nbsp; | [salih@prawnsgame.org.uk](mailto:salih@prawnsgame.org.uk) |

Oh, and Salih recently got a webpage and has been all smug about it so visit it at <a href="http://salihkadri.com"> salihkadri.com</a>

If you find a really serious issue that we can't fix, please feel free to do as Daniel does, and blame Salih.
