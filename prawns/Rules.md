The Meaning Of Life
===================

The aim of the game of Prawns is simple. One must use their prawns (set of pieces) to eat (take / destroy) every one of the enemies prawns, without their prawns being eaten first.

The Sea
=======

Everyone knows that prawns live in the sea, and this game knows it too. Prawns is played on a square checkered board (colloquially called the sea) that is eight squares high, and eight squares across. Conventionally, it has a black square in the bottom left position, however, this is not a rule that always needs to be followed.

A prawn must, if possible, stay within the sea, however, in a very particular case (as explained in the evaporation rule), it may be forced to move out of the sea and onto dry land, where it will asphyxiate.

Species of Prawn
================

There are many different species of prawn, with their own symbols and their own moves and abilities, as explained in the table below:
| New (Standard) Name | Old (Outdated) Name | Symbol | Description of Move | Diagram showing Move |
|---------------------+---------------------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+
| Krill | Unflavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of krill]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/krill.png) | Moves one space in any direction. | ![Move of krill]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/krillmove.png) |
| Shrimp | L-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of shrimp]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/shrimp.png) | Jumps in an L-shape or moves one space diagonally. | ![Move of shrimp]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/shrimpmove.png) |
| Crab | Perpendicularly-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of crab]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/crab.png) | Moves any distance along a row or a column. | ![Move of crab]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/crabmove.png) |
| Lobster | Diagonally-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of lobster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/lobster.png) | Moves any distance along a diagonal. | ![Move of lobster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/lobstermove.png) |

In the diagrams showing the moves, the first image shows that prawn in an arbitrary starting position, while the second, shows where it could go from that position (remember that you can click on pictures to see them enlarged in a new tab).

You'll notice that every species of prawn has two names, a new one and an old one. Everyone should really now use the new names, however, it might help to learn the old ones because people may accidentally use those names when talking.

The symbols shown are the official ones that are on the pieces in Prawns sets, and are the ones that are used in diagrams throughout these rules. They are relatively easy to learn because they actually show the moves the pieces make (apart from krill, which has the most basic symbol).
