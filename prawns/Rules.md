The Meaning Of Life
===================

The aim of the game of Prawns is simple. One must use their prawns (set of pieces) to eat (take / destroy) every one of the enemies prawns, without their prawns being eaten first.

The Sea
=======

Everyone knows that prawns live in the sea, and this game knows it too. Prawns is played on a square checkered board (colloquially called the sea) that is eight squares high, and eight squares across. Conventionally, it has a black square in the bottom left position, however, this is not a rule that always needs to be followed.

A prawn must, if possible, stay within the sea, however, in a very particular case (as explained in the evaporation rule), it may be forced to move out of the sea and onto dry land, where it will asphyxiate.

Species of Prawn
================

There are many different species of prawn, with their own symbols and their own moves and abilities, as explained in the table below:

| New (Standard) Name | Old (Outdated) Name | Symbol | Description of Move | Diagram showing Move |
|---------------------+---------------------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+
| Krill | Unflavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of krill]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/krill.png) | Moves one space in any direction. | ![Move of krill]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/krillmove.gif) |
| Shrimp | L-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of shrimp]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/shrimp.png) | Jumps in an L-shape or moves one space diagonally. | ![Move of shrimp]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/shrimpmove.gif) |
| Crab | Perpendicularly-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of crab]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/crab.png) | Moves any distance along a row or a column. | ![Move of crab]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/crabmove.gif) |
| Lobster | Diagonally-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of lobster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/lobster.png) | Moves any distance along a diagonal. | ![Move of lobster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/lobstermove.gif) |

In the diagrams showing the moves, the first image shows that prawn in an arbitrary starting position, while the second, shows where it could go from that position<!-- (remember that you can click on pictures to see them enlarged in a new tab)-->.

You'll notice that every species of prawn has two names, a new one and an old one. Everyone should really now use the new names, however, it might help to learn the old ones because people may accidentally use those names when talking.

The symbols shown are the official ones that are on the pieces in Prawns sets, and are the ones that are used in diagrams throughout these rules. They are relatively easy to learn because they actually show the moves the pieces make (apart from krill, which has the most basic symbol).

The Gene Pool
=============

The player starts with the gene pool (like an inventory) of the following prawns:

 - 8 x Krill
 - 2 x Shrimp
 - 2 x Crab
 - 2 x Lobster

All prawns come from the gene pool, and, when they die (are eaten) they must return to the gene pool. This is in contrast to other strategy games like Chess or Draughts where the taker gets to keep a taken piece - in Prawns the piece returns to the original owner, where it can, if wanted, be used again (see the eating and evolution rules).

As will be revealed later on, there are usually four more pieces that do not belong to any player and mark the four corners of the sea. These are necessary for the evaporation rule.

The Primordial Soup
===================

To begin the game, the board is set out like this:

![The initial board setup.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/setup.png)

*The different coloured pieces signify different sides (i.e. player 1 is blue and player 2 is green - note that the pieces in a Prawns set do not have to be blue and green, any two easily differentiable colours are fine).*

The player places the 8 unflavoured prawns in their starting positions (see above) and then selects two of the remaining pieces to go in the "any" spaces. The selection the player chooses may be kept secret from the opponent until the start of the game, so the opponent can't make a decision based on the player's choice, and vice versa, which can be done by placing an object in the middle of the board so that the other side cannot see the chosen pieces, until both sides have placed their pieces and agree to remove the object. This is called a "Blind Start" and must be done should either side request it, although it can be omitted through the mutual agreement of both sides. Note that once the the game has been officially started, a player cannot modify his/her initial choice.

Who Goes First?
===============

This is decided by the flipping of a coin, traditionally a golden one pence piece. The players must agree on who will choose to be heads and who is tails before the game begins. Should the players not be able to agree, an unbiased third party must decide. Should both sides not be able to make a mutual decision on who throws the coin, the unbiased third party will again have to step in and flip the coin. The coin must land on the prawns board, and must come to a stop naturally without obstruction of any object other than a prawns piece. Should it be obstructed by anything other than a Prawns piece or land outside the boundary of the Prawns board, the coin has to be be re-flipped immediately.

From here on, each player takes it in turns to make a single move (i.e. player 1 moves one of their prawns then player 2 moves one of their prawns, player 1, player 2, player 1, player 2 etc.) with only a few exceptions (see the evolution rule). Play continues in this way till the game ends.

Just Keep Swimming
==================

In the game of Prawns, there are two types of movement any prawn can do; swimming, and jumping. Of these two, swimming is the most basic, and, for that reason, we shall look at it first.

You have actually already seen the ways that the different species of prawn move when swimming - it was in the table in Chapter 3, so we won't go over it again here, however, for shrimp, crabs, and lobsters, there are a few more details that are required for you to properly understand swimming.

For shrimp, this detail is relatively simple - they do not have to swim. Instead, they are able to hop to their next position if necessary, which means that they can get there even if something is in their way (they simply hop over it). They can hop over anything: a friendly prawn, an enemy prawn , even an empty bit of sea, but they can only hop to the squares they would normally be able to swim to. See the diagram below for clarification:

![A shrimp hops over some krill of its own side.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/shrimphop.gif)

For crabs and lobsters, however, pieces can get in the way (note that this does not happen with krill as they only go a distance of 1). If a piece gets in the way of a crab or lobster, the crab or lobster cannot end up on a square behind it. Again, we have provided a diagram for clarification:

![A crab is blocked by krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/crabblock.gif)

*In this diagram, the small red x's indicate squares that are blocked from the crab because of the krill.*

The final thing you need to know about swimming is that it takes up a move (i.e. it is not possible to have a piece swim, then jump, within a single move, because jumping also takes up a move.

The Jump-Start
==============

In the game of Prawns, there are two and a half related, but relatively separate types of jumping: ordinary jumping (which includes the wall-jump), and the jump-start. None of these are to be confused with hopping - there are a few very important differences. The jump-start is a more specific, yet easier type of jumping, so we shall start with this.

The jump-start can be performed solely by krill, and even then, only on their first move. It involves them jumping two spaces forward (i.e. it jumps over one square, and lands in the one directly after), over anything apart from an enemy prawn, and then landing in an empty square. The following six diagrams and explanations show different situations and whether or not a jump-start is permitted:

![A single krill performing a jump-start.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/jumpstart1.gif) ![A krill performing a jump-start over a lobster.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/jumpstart2.gif)

*Jump-starts are allowed in these two situations because it is the krill's first move, they are not jumping over an enemy, and they are landing in an empty square.*

![Attempted jump-start over an enemy piece.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nojumpstart1.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because the krill is jumping over an enemy piece.*

![Attempted jump-start into an occupied square.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nojumpstart2.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because the krill would land in a square that is not empty.*

![Attempted jump-start after krill's first move.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nojumpstart3.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because it is not the krill's first move.*

![Attempted jump-start by a lobster.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nojumpstart4.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because it is not being performed by a krill.*

Plain Ol' Jumping
=================

As mentioned in the last chapter, the second type of jumping that can occur, is just that: ordinary jumping. In this chapter, we will look at all but the most unusual case of ordinary jumping (called the wall-jump). Like with the jump-start, there are a couple of specific points that need to be satisfied for an ordinary jump to be legal.

 - There are always two prawns of the same colour (side) involved in any single jump.
 - One of these prawns jumps over the other.
 - The two prawns must be on adjacent squares to begin with (this includes squares that are diagonally adjacent)
 - The jumping prawn must jump exactly one square directly over the other prawn and land in the following square so that the two prawns are still adjacent, but the jumping prawn is on the opposite side to the one it started on.
 - Jumping takes up a move (i.e. it is not possible to have a piece swim, then jump, within a single move, because swimming also takes up a move.

Finally, it is definitely worth adding that jumping can occur horizontally (left / right), vertically (up / down), and even diagonally, as well as that it can be performed by any prawn. Look at the following diagrams, read the explanations, and make sure you understand them before moving on.

![A krill jumping diagonally over another krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/diagonaljump.gif) ![A krill jumping vertically over another krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/verticaljump.gif)

*These are examples of legal jumps because they satisfy all the conditions above.*

![An attempted jump where the jumping krill lands on another krill of the opposing side.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nodiagonaljump1.gif)

*This jump is illegal because the krill isn't landing in an empty square.*

![An attempted jump where the jumping krill jumps over a krill of the opposing side.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nodiagonaljump2.gif)

*This jump is illegal because the krill isn't jumping over a prawn of the same side.*

![An attempted jump where a krill jumps over an empty square.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nodiagonaljump3.gif)

*This jump is illegal because the krill does not have a prawn from its side to jump over.*

![A crab jumping diagonally over a krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/crabjump.gif)

*This diagram shows that jumping works exactly the same with shrimp, crabs, and lobsters as it does with krill.*

Prawn Parkour
=============

The wall-jump is probably the weirdest rule in Prawns, the other candidate being the evaporation rule (there was also a joke rule proposed that would have been even weirder, and you can't yet read all about it here: [463 Rule](#)) and the good news is that it isn't very difficult to understand. Although the wall-jump is technically regarded as a very odd case of ordinary jumping, it's different enough to get its own chapter.

The wall-jump takes place when a diagonal jump occurs beside the edge of the sea, so that the square the jumping prawn would land on is just outside the boundary. In this case, instead of the move being illegal (which we thought was too boring), or the jumping prawn committing suicide (which we thought was too violent), the jumping prawn bounces off a wall and lands in the square adjacent to both the wall and the prawn being jumped over, but on the opposite side (see the diagrams if that was a bit confusing). Because the wall-jump is technically still an ordinary jump, all the usual rules apply (i.e. it must jump over a prawn of the same team, the landing square must be empty, etc - see the previous chapter for the details) however it has some details specific to itself (i.e. the jumping prawn must not begin by touching the wall that will be bounced off, while the prawn that is being jumped over must, and the fact that the wall-jump cannot be performed in reverse). Again it is worth remembering that, although we have only used krill in the diagrams, any prawn can take part in a wall-jump.

![One krill wall-jumps over another.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/walljump1.gif)

*A good example of a perfectly legal wall-jump.*

![One krill wall-jumps over another, bouncing off the top wall.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/walljump2.gif)

*Another good example of a perfectly legal wall-jump, showing that any wall will do.*

![One krill attempts to wall-jump over another at 90° to the wall.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nowalljump1.gif)

*This wall-jump is disallowed because it is not based on a diagonal jump.*

![One krill attempts to perform a reverse wall-jump.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nowalljump2.gif)

*This wall-jump is disallowed because the krill starts next to the wall, and lands away from it, while the correct version is the other way round.*

![One krill attempts to wall-jump over an enemy krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prawns/nowalljump3.gif)

*This wall-jump is disallowed because the krill is not jumping over a prawn of the same colour (side).*
