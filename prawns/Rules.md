The Meaning Of Life
===================

The aim of the game of Prawns is simple. One must use their prawns (set of pieces) to eat (take / destroy) every one of the enemies prawns, without their prawns being eaten first.

The Sea
=======

Everyone knows that prawns live in the sea, and this game knows it too. Prawns is played on a square checkered board (colloquially called the sea) that is eight squares high, and eight squares across. Conventionally, it has a black square in the bottom left position, however, this is not a rule that always needs to be followed.

A prawn must, if possible, stay within the sea, however, in a very particular case (as explained in the evaporation rule), it may be forced to move out of the sea and onto dry land, where it will asphyxiate.

Species of Prawn
================

There are many different species of prawn, with their own symbols and their own moves and abilities, as explained in the table below:

| New (Standard) Name | Old (Outdated) Name | Symbol | Description of Move | Diagram showing Move |
|---------------------+---------------------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+
| Krill | Unflavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of krill]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/krill.png) | Moves one space in any direction. | ![Move of krill]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/krillmove.gif) |
| Shrimp | L-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of shrimp]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/shrimp.png) | Jumps in an L-shape or moves one space diagonally. | ![Move of shrimp]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/shrimpmove.gif) |
| Crab | Perpendicularly-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of crab]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/crab.png) | Moves any distance along a row or a column. | ![Move of crab]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/crabmove.gif) |
| Lobster | Diagonally-Flavoured Prawn | ![Symbol of lobster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/lobster.png) | Moves any distance along a diagonal. | ![Move of lobster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/lobstermove.gif) |

In the diagrams showing the moves, the first image shows that prawn in an arbitrary starting position, while the second, shows where it could go from that position<!-- (remember that you can click on pictures to see them enlarged in a new tab)-->.

You'll notice that every species of prawn has two names, a new one and an old one. Everyone should really now use the new names, however, it might help to learn the old ones because people may accidentally use those names when talking.

The symbols shown are the official ones that are on the pieces in Prawns sets, and are the ones that are used in diagrams throughout these rules. They are relatively easy to learn because they actually show the moves the pieces make (apart from krill, which has the most basic symbol).

The Gene Pool
=============

The player starts with the gene pool (like an inventory) of the following prawns:

 - 8 x Krill
 - 2 x Shrimp
 - 2 x Crab
 - 2 x Lobster

All prawns come from the gene pool, and, when they die (are eaten) they must return to the gene pool. This is in contrast to other strategy games like Chess or Draughts where the taker gets to keep a taken piece - in Prawns the piece returns to the original owner, where it can, if wanted, be used again (see the eating and evolution rules).

As will be revealed later on, there are usually four more pieces that do not belong to any player and mark the four corners of the sea. These are necessary for the evaporation rule.

The Primordial Soup
===================

To begin the game, the board is set out like this:

![The initial board setup.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/setup.png)

*The different coloured pieces signify different sides (i.e. player 1 is blue and player 2 is green - note that the pieces in a Prawns set do not have to be blue and green, any two easily differentiable colours are fine).*

The player places the 8 unflavoured prawns in their starting positions (see above) and then selects two of the remaining pieces to go in the "any" spaces. The selection the player chooses may be kept secret from the opponent until the start of the game, so the opponent can't make a decision based on the player's choice, and vice versa, which can be done by placing an object in the middle of the board so that the other side cannot see the chosen pieces, until both sides have placed their pieces and agree to remove the object. This is called a "Blind Start" and must be done should either side request it, although it can be omitted through the mutual agreement of both sides. Note that once the the game has been officially started, a player cannot modify his/her initial choice.

Who Goes First?
===============

This is decided by the flipping of a coin, traditionally a golden one pence piece. The players must agree on who will choose to be heads and who is tails before the game begins. Should the players not be able to agree, an unbiased third party must decide. Should both sides not be able to make a mutual decision on who throws the coin, the unbiased third party will again have to step in and flip the coin. The coin must land on the prawns board, and must come to a stop naturally without obstruction of any object other than a prawns piece. Should it be obstructed by anything other than a Prawns piece or land outside the boundary of the Prawns board, the coin has to be be re-flipped immediately.

From here on, each player takes it in turns to make a single move (i.e. player 1 moves one of their prawns then player 2 moves one of their prawns, player 1, player 2, player 1, player 2 etc.) with only a few exceptions (see the evolution rule). Play continues in this way till the game ends.

Just Keep Swimming
==================

In the game of Prawns, there are two types of movement any prawn can do; swimming, and jumping. Of these two, swimming is the most basic, and, for that reason, we shall look at it first.

You have actually already seen the ways that the different species of prawn move when swimming - it was in the table in Chapter 3, so we won't go over it again here, however, for shrimp, crabs, and lobsters, there are a few more details that are required for you to properly understand swimming.

For shrimp, this detail is relatively simple - they do not have to swim. Instead, they are able to hop to their next position if necessary, which means that they can get there even if something is in their way (they simply hop over it). They can hop over anything: a friendly prawn, an enemy prawn , even an empty bit of sea, but they can only hop to the squares they would normally be able to swim to. See the diagram below for clarification:

![A shrimp hops over some krill of its own side.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/shrimphop.gif)

For crabs and lobsters, however, pieces can get in the way (note that this does not happen with krill as they only go a distance of 1). If a piece gets in the way of a crab or lobster, the crab or lobster cannot end up on a square behind it. Again, we have provided a diagram for clarification:

![A crab is blocked by krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/crabblock.gif)

*In this diagram, the small red x's indicate squares that are blocked from the crab because of the krill.*

The final thing you need to know about swimming is that it takes up a move (i.e. it is not possible to have a piece swim, then jump, within a single move, because jumping also takes up a move.

The Jump-Start
==============

In the game of Prawns, there are two and a half related, but relatively separate types of jumping: ordinary jumping (which includes the wall-jump), and the jump-start. None of these are to be confused with hopping - there are a few very important differences. The jump-start is a more specific, yet easier type of jumping, so we shall start with this.

The jump-start can be performed solely by krill, and even then, only on their first move. It involves them jumping two spaces forward (i.e. it jumps over one square, and lands in the one directly after), over anything apart from an enemy prawn, and then landing in an empty square. The following six diagrams and explanations show different situations and whether or not a jump-start is permitted:

![A single krill performing a jump-start.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/jumpstart1.gif) ![A krill performing a jump-start over a lobster.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/jumpstart2.gif)

*Jump-starts are allowed in these two situations because it is the krill's first move, they are not jumping over an enemy, and they are landing in an empty square.*

![Attempted jump-start over an enemy piece.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nojumpstart1.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because the krill is jumping over an enemy piece.*

![Attempted jump-start into an occupied square.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nojumpstart2.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because the krill would land in a square that is not empty.*

![Attempted jump-start after krill's first move.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nojumpstart3.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because it is not the krill's first move.*

![Attempted jump-start by a lobster.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nojumpstart4.gif)

*This jump-start is illegal because it is not being performed by a krill.*

Plain Ol' Jumping
=================

As mentioned in the last chapter, the second type of jumping that can occur, is just that: ordinary jumping. In this chapter, we will look at all but the most unusual case of ordinary jumping (called the wall-jump). Like with the jump-start, there are a couple of specific points that need to be satisfied for an ordinary jump to be legal.

 - There are always two prawns of the same colour (side) involved in any single jump.
 - One of these prawns jumps over the other.
 - The two prawns must be on adjacent squares to begin with (this includes squares that are diagonally adjacent)
 - The jumping prawn must jump exactly one square directly over the other prawn and land in the following square so that the two prawns are still adjacent, but the jumping prawn is on the opposite side to the one it started on.
 - Jumping takes up a move (i.e. it is not possible to have a piece swim, then jump, within a single move, because swimming also takes up a move.

Finally, it is definitely worth adding that jumping can occur horizontally (left / right), vertically (up / down), and even diagonally, as well as that it can be performed by any prawn. Look at the following diagrams, read the explanations, and make sure you understand them before moving on.

![A krill jumping diagonally over another krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/diagonaljump.gif) ![A krill jumping vertically over another krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/verticaljump.gif)

*These are examples of legal jumps because they satisfy all the conditions above.*

![An attempted jump where the jumping krill lands on another krill of the opposing side.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nodiagonaljump1.gif)

*This jump is illegal because the krill isn't landing in an empty square.*

![An attempted jump where the jumping krill jumps over a krill of the opposing side.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nodiagonaljump2.gif)

*This jump is illegal because the krill isn't jumping over a prawn of the same side.*

![An attempted jump where a krill jumps over an empty square.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nodiagonaljump3.gif)

*This jump is illegal because the krill does not have a prawn from its side to jump over.*

![A crab jumping diagonally over a krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/crabjump.gif)

*This diagram shows that jumping works exactly the same with shrimp, crabs, and lobsters as it does with krill.*

Prawn Parkour
=============

The wall-jump is probably the weirdest rule in Prawns, the other candidate being the evaporation rule (there was also a joke rule proposed that would have been even weirder, and you can't yet read all about it here: [463 Rule](#)) and the good news is that it isn't very difficult to understand. Although the wall-jump is technically regarded as a very odd case of ordinary jumping, it's different enough to get its own chapter.

The wall-jump takes place when a diagonal jump occurs beside the edge of the sea, so that the square the jumping prawn would land on is just outside the boundary. In this case, instead of the move being illegal (which we thought was too boring), or the jumping prawn committing suicide (which we thought was too violent), the jumping prawn bounces off a wall and lands in the square adjacent to both the wall and the prawn being jumped over, but on the opposite side (see the diagrams if that was a bit confusing). Because the wall-jump is technically still an ordinary jump, all the usual rules apply (i.e. it must jump over a prawn of the same team, the landing square must be empty, etc - see the previous chapter for the details) however it has some details specific to itself (i.e. the jumping prawn must not begin by touching the wall that will be bounced off, while the prawn that is being jumped over must, and the fact that the wall-jump cannot be performed in reverse). Again it is worth remembering that, although we have only used krill in the diagrams, any prawn can take part in a wall-jump.

![One krill wall-jumps over another.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/walljump1.gif)

*A good example of a perfectly legal wall-jump.*

![One krill wall-jumps over another, bouncing off the top wall.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/walljump2.gif)

*Another good example of a perfectly legal wall-jump, showing that any wall will do.*

![One krill attempts to wall-jump over another at 90° to the wall.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nowalljump1.gif)

*This wall-jump is disallowed because it is not based on a diagonal jump.*

![One krill attempts to perform a reverse wall-jump.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nowalljump2.gif)

*This wall-jump is disallowed because the krill starts next to the wall, and lands away from it, while the correct version is the other way round.*

![One krill attempts to wall-jump over an enemy krill.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nowalljump3.gif)

*This wall-jump is disallowed because the krill is not jumping over a prawn of the same colour (side).*

Tasty Prawns
============

Now that we have finished with jumping, it is time to face the harsh realities of Prawns. Prawns is like many other complex ecosystems, and, in most complex ecosystems, the animals like to eat other animals. In Prawns, it is no different.

In order to win a game of prawns, you must eat every one of the opponents pieces, before they eat every one of your pieces. In order to eat an enemy piece, simply move one of your pieces into a square occupied by the opponent you wish to eat. You will now occupy that square, their piece will have been eaten and will return to their gene pool.

Please remember, also, that it is impossible to take an enemy piece with a jump (either jump-start, ordinary jump, or wall-jump) this is because the landing space for the jump must be vacant (if you're still confused, re-read the previous 3 chapters). On the other hand, it is perfectly legal for a shrimp to eat, having landed in a square using its hop - remember that the hop and the jump are very different things.

As a final point, it is useful to know that it is illegal to eat prawns of your own team, meaning that you can only eat enemy prawns (no assisted suicide, only murder).

![Many Prawns eating each other.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/eating.gif)

*Halfway through this game there seems to have been an all-you-can-eat buffet! Not all the prawns were that pleased, however. (Even though this .gif is quite fast, try to pick out as when one prawn eats another as much as possible.)*

The Evaporation Rule
====================

The first thing you need to know about draws (ties / stalemates) in the game of prawns is that there are none! In prawns, it is impossible for the game to end in a draw (tie / stalemate) due to the evaporation rule (this was actually the main reason we thought this rule up).

The way this rule works is that when the total number of pieces on the board is reduced to five, the the sea will start to evaporate (the board will shrink) into the shape of the smallest rectangle necessary to fit the remaining prawns on the board. From then on, this continues after every move, forcing the players together, until one outsmarts the other and the game ends suddenly. It has the advantage that it adds lots of excitement and intrigue to the end-game, sometimes with the result being the exact opposite of what you expected!

The most common method of showing this in real life is the use of four corner pieces which, for a large portion of the game, sit at the corners of the board, but as soon as there are only five prawns left, move in to mark the edges of the now shrunken sea. In the diagram below, they shall be represented as red L-shapes.

![Diagram showing how evaporation works in a game.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/evaporation.gif)

*In this example of a relatively inexperienced blue player against the green player, the green player uses evaporation to his/her advantage to ensure his/her victory. The important thing, however, is not that you can follow the game (which is very difficult in a fast moving .gif) but that you understand that the sea is always shrinking to the rectangle that is only just big enough to hold the remaining prawns.*

What happens when the evaporation rule leaves a player with no available moves? It is difficult to think of a case where this is true, but one example is given in the diagram below. Here, the lobster must move along a diagonal, but the sea has evaporated in such a way that no diagonal is available. In this unfortunate case, the lobster must move out of the sea, where it will asphyxiate (it is committing suicide), and meaning the game is won by the blue team. Committing suicide in this way is not allowed in any other situation, but it is necessary here as it is the only move available. It may seem unfair that blue still wins when this is the only move possible, but avoiding these situations or forcing them onto the other team is simply another part of the end-game tactics, and another way to win.

![Diagram showing a rare case where a player doesn't seem to be able to make a move.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/nomove.png)

*(Green's turn to move)*

*Here, the lobster cannot make a move, and must therefore commit suicide.*

The Evolution Rule
==================

Despite being more like the Pokemon version than its real counterpart, evolution in Prawns still turns one species into another, and is a very important part of the game. The least evolved stage is krill, with the equally developed species of shrimp, crab, and lobster making up the evolved stage.

![The starting layout, with colour-coded end rows showing the evolution zones.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images{{ page.folder }}/evolutionzones.png)

*This is the same picture as the one you saw in Chapter 5, but with the evolution zones added. The blue krill (top) need to get to the blue evolution zone (bottom) while the green krill (bottom) need to get to the green evolution zone (top).*

To become evolved, a krill needs to get all the way to the opposite end of the board (see the diagram and its caption), often called the evolution zone, where it has the ability to evolve. If the sea has started evaporating, the evolution zone becomes the row closest to the original evolution zone. The evolution itself can be easily summed up using just four points:

 - An evolution will always take place in the evolution zone corresponding to that krill.
 - An evolution does not take up a move.
 - Because it doesn't take up a move, you can perform as many evolutions as you can in a move, either at the beginning of the move, the end, or both!
 - During an evolution, a krill is swapped with a prawn of any evolved species (shrimp, crab, or lobster) that you have in your gene pool.

However, there is actually a second type of evolution: re-evolution. This is when an evolved species (shrimp, crab, or lobster) changes into a different evolved species. This works almost exactly the same way a standard evolution does (just not using a krill - either as a start or endpoint) except that, with re-evolution, there is one extra rule:

 - For re-evolution to occur, there must be at least six prawns on the board.

This rule has the effect that, once the sea is able to start shrinking, all re-evolution is banned.

Finally, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as de-evolution. Anyone who tells you that there is is either lying or horribly mistaken (they may throw the excuse that 'the old rules had de-evolution in them' at you. If they say this they are still lying, it may have been harder to interpret the old rules correctly [and it may have also been a while since they last played, causing them to forget a few exactitudes] but the only correct interpretation was [and still is] that there is not de-evolution).

Who's King Prawn?
=================

A winner is decided (and the game ends) when all the prawns on the board are of the same side (colour / team). When that has happened, the player who's prawns they were can be declared the winner, and graciously accept their prize (whether that be a trophy, admiration from their fellow prawns players, or just hatred from the beaten opposition is, however, another story).

Additional Information
======================

In Prawns, we do not have a rule that says, if you've touched the piece, you have to move it. Instead, we almost always say that you can redo your move, provided that the next person hasn't started their move. However, we also consider it very bad etiquette to "start" your move, when in reality you're just touching a piece so that the other person can't redo their move.

Other Flavours
==============

It is occasionally (and wrongly) stated that Prawns is simply another variant of Chess. It is, instead, actually a separate game. However, this does not make it immune to having variations made of it - in fact, we will often actively encourage the making of variations (please don't make too many though, as that can stop you from enjoying normal Prawns).

An interesting variation is that of the game of Q-Prawns, with a larger board, and twice as many pieces, which means it can accommodate 4 players, as well as the usual 2 (hopefully, rules will soon be appearing for this game).

There are, however, more minor variations that can be made, for example, in the standard game of prawns, once a piece is taken, it is returned to the players inventory and can be revived when a prawn reaches the opposite side of the board without being taken. In one variation, it may be agreed prior to the game by the participants that once a piece is taken once, it is gone for good.

Another variation to try is to play the game on a reduced board size (with a reduced quantity of normal prawns to fit), such as 7x7 or 6x6. below 5x5 is not recommended as it would not allow for much freedom of movement and the game (which isn't long to begin with) would not last for very long at all. In fact, the board needn't even be a square! Try playing with boards of 5x8 etc. - different shapes bring different qualities to the game! Some people have played Chess on a hexagonal board, so if you can do that, why not try the same with Prawns - the possibilities are endless.
