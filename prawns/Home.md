The game of Prawns is (in its standard form) an abstract two player board game, requiring concentration, problem solving, and strategy. Like Kalamala, it was invented by two people (in this case Zachary Barnett and Daniel Sherlock), but is in general taken far less seriously (this is no less fun, and often makes for a nice change).

It has quite a few rules and is not as intuitive as Kalamala, but it is not so complex as to be harder to understand than Chess. Each game lasts between 20 and 40 minutes, usually depending on when the bus home is timetabled to arrive (as players will play more slowly if they know they still have half an hour left).

Prawns was born when its creators were bored of Chess (we don't have the longest of attention spans) and if you think that is it just the same is mistaken - it has a very different flow of play to it. Because of its means of inception, it could be thought of almost as a parody of Chess, with moves such as the wall jump mocking moves such as En Passent in Chess (though the wall jump actually makes more sense and is far more useful). Even the vague theme of a battle chess has is made fun of by the dodgily implemented sea-related concepts that flow (pun intended) through the rules. That said, many of the similarities between it and Chess (such as the fact that some pieces have similar moves) were put in not for comedic effect but rather to make the Chess-inflicted player feel slightly less uncomfortable.

As an extention to the fact that the game itself is very comedic, the play environment (often termed the meta-game) is also very relaxed and enternatining. For example, we suggest that you listen, or hum to some crazy-fun-music, while bobbing your head up and down. If you don't know where to get started, we would like to reccomend a bit of Jean-Michelle Jarre, but advanced players will be able to sing or hum their own rythms, even demonstrating great skill at Prawns by consistently harmonising off each other mid-game.

The game itself is considered stable and it is now likely that most new aspects when it comes to the game will come in the form of spin offs which we hope to document well.

NB: As Prawns was actually the first game invented and then finished by Prawnsgame, it has ended up giving its name to the Disorganisation the website of which you are currently reading.
