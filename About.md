Prawnsgame is a website dedicated to bringing you new and interesting abstract strategy board games.

The people behind it are (at the moment) Zachary Barnett, Daniel Sherlock, and Salih Kadri. We form a disorganisation (like an organisation in that we work towards one rough goal - except there is no goal set, we do it intermittently because we would be too bored otherwise, and we are in no way organised) the 'aim' of which is to enjoy playing and creating abstract strategy board games.

So far, we have designed numerous games, including Cavalry and Skopeo (working name), but the only two we would consider finished (these two are also our most well-known games) are Prawns and Kalamala (also known as Kineo). You can visit the [Kalamala mini-site](/kalamala/) which currently contains an introduction and a set of rules, and we've recently finished the documentation for [Prawns](/prawns/) which we hope you'll enjoy.

As might be obvious, the Prawnsgame Disorganisation is named after the very first proper game it produced: Prawns. That said, we often play the other games (such as Kalamala) as we like playing each one for different reasons.
