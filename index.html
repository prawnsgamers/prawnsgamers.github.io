<h1>Welcome to Prawnsgame.org.uk!</h1>
<p>We spent far too much time offline, and are now back with a new, improved, easily updateable site design. Yay. ;)</p>
<p>Over the next few days (weeks?) we will be adding lots of content - getting back to our previous state of a full documentation of the game 'Prawns', and also adding some extra games we've made, such as the newly renamed Kalamala.</p>
<p>We (the people behind this website) are a rough disorganisation of people who, amongst other things, like, or have liked, to design abstact strategy board games and then publish them here. Find out less about us at our <a href="/about/">About</a> page.</p>
<p>Excitingly, we have started on a project to bring you a digital Kalamara experience. Our <a href="/kalamala/play/">Play</a> page will be updated with details as we make progress.</p>
