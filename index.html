<h1>Welcome to Prawnsgame.org.uk!</h1>

<p>We spent far too much time offline, and are now back with a new, improved, easily updateable site design. Yay. ;)</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks we have been adding lots of content - working tirelessly to get back to our previous state of a full documentation of the game <a href="/Prawns/">Prawns</a>, and also adding some extra games we've made, such as the newly renamed <a href="/Kalamala/">Kalamala</a>.</p>

<p>We (the people behind this website) are a rough disorganisation of people who, amongst other things, like, or have liked, to design abstract strategy board games and then publish them here. Find out more about us at our <a href="/About/">About</a> page.</p>

<p>Excitingly, we have started on a project to bring you a digital Kalamara experience. Our <a href="/Kalamala/Play/">Play</a> page will be updated with details as we make progress.</p>
